# Bitlocker-RemoteBitlockerMgmt

A powershell script/tool for remotely managing bitlocker, technically also has the ability to control bitlocker on the local host, but thats not the point of the script.

May or may not work depending on how your firewall is configured and remote management settings. I'm writing this at 3am almost a year after writing the script and I do not remember which windows patch that broke it or the specifics of how it did it. Mostly uploading to reuse code later..
